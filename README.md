This project uses the Heart Disease UCI Dataset from Kaggle, originally sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains clinical and medical attributes used to predict the presence of heart disease.

The data is provided in CSV format and includes numerical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, maximum heart rate, and other medical measurements.

The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0) based on the provided clinical features.
